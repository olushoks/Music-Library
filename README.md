# Music-Library 🎧🎵🎤

## ABOUT


Platform for a music lover to keep a library of their favorite songs. With total control of managing the library, user can add new song(s) to the libarary, edit and delete songs.

Much more, there is the filter option to enhance quick search within the library based on TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, GENRE OR RELEASE DATE.

## HOW TO ACCESS

Music-Library has both Front-End (Client-Side) & Back-End (Server-Side) features.

The Front-End is responsible for fetching songs from the Server and displaying to the user.

The Back-End is where the songs are stored. So every addition, edit or deletion is reflected here in real time.

###### BACK-END

1. Navigate to the back-end in the terminal or CLI.
2. npm install to download the dependencies
3. npm start to spin the server. It will default to http://localhost:5000. If you'd like to use a different port, navigate to the index.js file, and make the change on Line 15

###### FRONT-END

1. Navigate to the front-end in the terminal or CLI.
2. npm install to download the dependencies
3. npm start to spin the server. It will default to http://localhost:3000 if you do not have anything currently on it, otherwise, it will ask in the terminal/CLI if you'd like to spin it on another port.

## TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS

The Front-End is a react app. It utilizes AXIOS to fetch data from the back-end, and some BOOTSTRAP for UI design

The Back-End runs on NodeJS/ExpressJS. CORS is also used to enable both front-end and back-end run from same origin.

## SUGGESTION(S)

If you have suggestion(s) on what could have been done better or a feature that can be added or implemented differently, I am open to collaboration 😇👯‍♂️🤝
